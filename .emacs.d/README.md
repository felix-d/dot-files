dot-emacs
=========

My .emacs.d folder. I switched from Vim a month ago, so my config may be sloppy at this point.

I aim for an efficient configuration free of excessive fluffyness.

I tried [Evil-mode](https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home) but abandonned after a few days. Despite [Evil-mode](https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home) being excessively well developped,
I felt I was betraying Emacs and its usage didn't feel as homogeneous across all modes as I wanted it to be.

>**Emacs** is the most insane piece of software, because you can customize it endlessly to fit your most obscure needs.



**TODO**

Transforming every custom elisp files in *.org* files Ã  la [emacs24-starter-kit](https://github.com/eschulte/emacs24-starter-kit).
